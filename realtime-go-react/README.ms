# Real-Time Deadline-Aware Event Monitor

This project is a **real-time web application** that demonstrates how deadline-aware systems behave under load. It simulates a stream of events generated at a fixed rate, processes them with strict time constraints, and visualizes the results live in the browser.

The goal of this project is to show that **real-time systems are not just about speed, but about predictability and deadlines**.

---

## 🚀 What This App Does

* Generates events every **50 milliseconds** on the backend
* Assigns each event a **deadline**
* Processes events with simulated work
* Classifies events as:

  * ✅ **On-time** (processed before the deadline)
  * ❌ **Late** (processed after the deadline)
  * ⚠️ **Dropped** (discarded due to system overload)
* Streams results to the frontend in **real time using WebSockets**
* Displays live metrics and a continuously updating table

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Instead of buffering endlessly, the system:

* Uses **bounded queues** to apply backpressure
* **Drops work intentionally** when overloaded
* Makes system behavior visible rather than hiding failures

This mirrors how real-world systems like trading platforms, IoT pipelines, and real-time monitoring tools are designed.
